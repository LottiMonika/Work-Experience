# Work Experience

Welcome! This section of the repository highlights selected professional projects I've led or contributed to, with a focus on real-world impact, problem-solving, and cross-functional collaboration.

Each subfolder contains project-specific documentation such as planning breakdowns, implementation details, and outcomes. These projects demonstrate a mix of technical coordination, stakeholder management, and process improvement.

Explore each one to learn more about how I approach challenges and deliver results.
