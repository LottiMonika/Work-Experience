# 📊 Workforce Management Software Rollout

This project documents the end-to-end planning, execution, and rollout of a new Workforce Management (WFM) software for a Customer Service department scaling from 100 to 200+ agents.

As the project lead, I owned the full delivery cycle — from stakeholder alignment and rollout planning to testing, training, and post-implementation support. This GitHub repository showcases the key project planning documents used to structure and manage the implementation.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Our legacy WFM system was no longer fit for a growing, multi-channel Customer Service team. It caused performance issues, scheduling errors, and heavy manual workloads for WFM analysts. This project aimed to replace it with a modern, secure, and automation-friendly WFM platform — improving efficiency, agent experience, and data quality.

- ✅ Improved scheduling accuracy
- ✅ SLA monitoring through real-time dashboards
- ✅ Automated absence approvals (target: 75%)
- ✅ 8+ hours/week saved in WFM manual effort
